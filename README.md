# Digital Image Processing

This repository contains a collection of digital image processing techniques implemented using Python.  
The primary focus is on foundational operations such as image enhancement, filtering, and transformation, which are essential for understanding and developing more advanced computer vision applications.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

- *DIP_LAB.ipynb*: A Jupyter Notebook demonstrating various image processing techniques, including:
  - Grayscale conversion
  - Histogram equalization
  - Spatial filtering (e.g., Gaussian blur, median filtering)
  - Edge detection (e.g., Sobel, Canny)
  - Morphological operations (e.g., dilation, erosion)
  - Image transformations (e.g., rotation, scaling)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- *Programming Language*: Python
- *Libraries*:
  - numpy: For numerical operations
  - matplotlib: For plotting and visualization
  - opencv-python (cv2): For image processing functions
  - scikit-image: For additional image processing capabilities

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation

1. *Clone the repository*:

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/Panda1304/Digital_Image_Processing.git
   cd Digital_Image_Processing
   

2. *Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)*:

   bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   

3. *Install the required packages*:

   bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib opencv-python scikit-image
   

4. *Launch Jupyter Notebook*:

   bash
   jupyter notebook
   

   Then, open DIP_LAB.ipynb to explore the image processing techniques.
